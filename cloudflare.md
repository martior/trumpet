#Trumpet

This app lets you put a small message at the top of your site. 

You turn it on, and when you need to tell your users something, you enter a message and it will show the next time the user loads your site. If the user dismisses the message by clicking on it, Trumpet will not show it again for 24 hours. 

Trumpet can be used to:

* Notify users about upcoming service disruptions

* Proactively handle service disruptions, keeping your visitors informed
